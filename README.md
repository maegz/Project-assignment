<h3>Idea and practice</h3>
<p>The ideas changed a lot during the process, but the main focus has been on a good layup for computer screens. I wanted  something that is not too scaled down like todays Bootstrap pages, so a big part of the project turned out to be a lot of CSS-tuning and jQuery animations/effects.</p>

<p>When the homepage styling was good enough I started working on a memory-game. Just for the sake of trying to try out my new skills with JavaScript and jQuery. Making the base structure of the game was not too hard. The problem was to keep the scores and be able to restart the game. I got in to a dead end and had to start from scratch. While using different arrays to store different results, splitting up some functions and marking the images with onclick-functions, I could start to compare results against each other and dedicate some functions for new startup of the game.<br>
After the long process of making the game work, I could focus on adding fade-in/outs and structure it up a bit.</p>

<p>Game done and making a comfortable transition over the different pages was the next step. By using a switch-case-function through clicking on the nav-links, I made it possible to fade the different contents in and out, for a smooth visual feeling, and still keep everything on one page.</p>

<p>In the end I have added some plain HTML-pages and tried to make everything more adaptable to mobile devices. Skipping the background-image and making the hovering effect on both jumbotron and footer disappear makes it more suitable for the loading time when on phones and such.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The page is now something that I probably will work more on, since it's a small presentation about me and my work. Tweaking and tuning needs to be done, since there are some aesthetic flaws in both game, code structure and screen size-changing.
But all in all, I'm rather satisfied to call this my first project, and glad that I finally fixed the game.</p>
